# 4500 Irish Vocabulary Sentences for Obsidian Spaced Repetition

An adaptation of [michmech's Irish Sentence Bank](https://github.com/michmech/irish-sentence-bank). A simple .md file containing approximately 4500 Irish-English flashcard sentences for language learning via [st3v3nmw's Spaced Repetition plugin](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) for Obsidian.md. These use the '??' separator, meaning the flashcards are automatically double-sided - both Irish-to-English and English-to-Irish.

## Installation

Place IrishVocabulary.md into your Obsidian Vault directory. The Spaced Repetition plugin may take a few seconds to load it in, so be patient.
